Livecoding experiments

* Status
- Running:
  `ghci`
  `ghci> :script BootTidal.hs`
  properly loads Tidal.

  I was not yet able to get any sound to play,
  though I was able to verify that tidal establishes a connection to and runs commands through
  the backend SuperCollider and SuperDirt engine.

  TODO:
  - Try to get sound playing
  - Help Emacs mode find the port
  - Fix 'C-Enter' for Emacs mode evaluation (or use whatever Coq mode uses)
  - Actually play sound!
