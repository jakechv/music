Livecoding experiments

* Status
- Running:
  `ghci`
  `ghci> :script BootTidal.hs`
  properly loads Tidal.

  I was not yet able to get any sound to play,
  though I was able to verify that tidal establishes a connection to and runs commands through
  the backend SuperCollider and SuperDirt engine.

  TODO:
  - Try to get sound playing
  - Help Emacs mode find the port
  - Fix 'C-Enter' for Emacs mode evaluation (or use whatever Coq mode uses)
  - Actually play sound!

I'm pretty sure I could hear sound of some sort!
However, pressing the volume buttons was not able to adjust the volume of the program.
* Steps
- Boot SuperCollider:
  `sclang`
  `SuperCollider> SuperDirt.start`
- Boot TidalCycles:
  `ghci`
  `ghci> :script BootTidal.hs`
- Configure for Emacs:
  M-x rename-buffer vterm<{whatever}> "*tidal*"
  Emacs is configured to read to and write from a buffer with this name
